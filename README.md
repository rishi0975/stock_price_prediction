# 📈 Stock Market Prediction Project  

## 🔍 Introduction  
The objective of this project was to analyze historical stock market data and develop predictive models to forecast stock prices. We used **TATA Power share data** as a case study to understand market trends and build a robust predictive framework.  

The project's primary focus was to identify the most effective machine learning and deep learning models for time-series forecasting, ensuring reliable and actionable insights for future stock movements.  

By leveraging advanced algorithms and statistical techniques, this project aims to provide accurate predictions that empower data-driven investment decisions.
